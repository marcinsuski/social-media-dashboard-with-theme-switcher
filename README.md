## Overview
This project challenges you in making a theme switcher to a social media dashboard. The page must be responsive as well and allow pc/mobile view.
I chose this challenge to learn dealing with dark/light themes that are very popular in web nowadays. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process
1. I decided to practice SASS in this project. I began with planning the html structure, taking into consideration both mobile and pc view. I also started using BEM css naming. 
2. I styled the content starting from mobile view - light mode only.
3. Then I styled the pc view and moved on to darkmode theme.
4. I added styles in css for darkmode and added all to js to control theme switcher. 

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned
How to make a the switcher and deal with theme changing issues. I learned that during planning html structure I should also think about dealing with other themes.
